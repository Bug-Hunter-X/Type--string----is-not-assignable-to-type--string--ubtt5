This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error: assigning an array of strings to a function that expects a single string.  The `greeter` function is designed to take a single string as input, but we're passing it an array. The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario by either iterating through the array and calling the function multiple times or modifying the function to accept an array.
